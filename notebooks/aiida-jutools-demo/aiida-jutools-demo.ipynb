    "Decription: Demo of [AiiDA-JuTools](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-jutools) for [JuDFTteam](https://github.com/JuDFTteam) AiiDA [hackathon 2022-12-01](https://iffmd.fz-juelich.de/ud8C294VQ5achi2GGj-D9A#). Intended to be run on [iffAiiDA](https://ifflogin.fz-juelich.de/), any AiiDA v1.x image there (for instance, `aiida-stable`, `aiida-develop`). Requires existence of AiiDA computer node `iffslurm` (IFF cluster)."

    "Contributing: In an iffaiida-image, run `setup-ssh-server` in a terminal. Follow the instructions (needs [SSH key -- based access](https://iffmd.fz-juelich.de/-sZTHayUSFaI7dPdbwEuPg#How-to-add-an-SSH-key-for-remote-access)). Connect your local IDE ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview), [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote.html), ...) to your iffAiiDA Python environment. Now you can edit the `aiida-jutools` source code and share your own AiiDA JuTools with your colleagues via GitHub. Johannes can help you set this up."
