"""AiiDA JuTools.

We recommended to use this library with the import statement ``import aiida_jutools as jutools``. In your code,
you can then call all available tools like so: ``jutools.package.tool()``.
"""
__version__ = "0.1.0-dev1"

# Import all of the library's user packages.

# # import all of the library's developer packages.
from . import _dev

# Potentially problematic imports:
# - kkr: As soon as aiida-kkr becomes dependent on aiida-jutools, this import could introduce a circular
#        dependency. One solution to that might be to *not* import kkr here, but require that it is imported
#        separately by the user, e.g. like from aiida_jutools import kkr as _jutools_kkr.
