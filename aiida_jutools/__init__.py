"""AiiDA JuTools.

We recommended to use this library with the import statement ``import aiida_jutools as jutools``. In your code,
you can then call all available tools like so: ``jutools.package.tool()``.

Plugin tools are not loaded globally, as they might not be installed. Instead, import as needed. Example for the
plugin aiida-kkr: ``import aiida_jutools.plugins.kkr as jutools_kkr``.

__version__ = "0.1.0-dev1"

# Potentially problematic imports:
# - kkr: As soon as aiida-kkr becomes dependent on aiida-jutools, this import MIGHT introduce a circular
#        dependencies. A simple test (made aiida-kkr import aiida-jutools) had no such effect. But if it
#        occurs, here are some possible solutions:
#        - Hide all aiida-kkr imports = in resp. module, move them inside the tools that use them. If it works,
#          this might be a solution that does not break external code.
#        - Remove aiida-kkr dependency altogether from aiida-jutools.
#
# The potential problem and the solution stated above, if it becomes one, applies to other plugin tools as well,
# should they start using aiida-jutools as common codebase (aiida-fleur, aiida-spirit, aiida-spex, ...).
