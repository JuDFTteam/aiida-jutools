    Use cases:
    1) Rescaling structures by a set of different scaling factors. Store not only the provenance between
    structure and scaling factors, but also between an individual scaling factor and the whole set. To realize
    the latter, first store the set as List of floats. Then link the List with a set of Floats by itemizing it
    with this method.

    Currently supported Data types: Bool, Int, Float, Str, Dict.
